# parking_lot

-  Design a parking lot which can hold n cars of different color and different registration numbers.
-  Every car has been issued a ticket for a spot and the spot has been assigned based on the nearest to the entry point.
-  The system should also return some queries such as:
    * Registration numbers of all cars of a particular Color.
    * Ticket number in which a car with a given registration number is placed.
    * Ticket numbers of all tickets where a car of a particular color is placed.
        - This should be a simple command line utility with minimum these capabilities.
